#Note - on google, EBS storage of a truecrypt encrypted partition passed the closest I can get to a "disk pull plug" test.  A single pass doesn't prove much - only that the system isn't horribly broken.  It was also getting around 120 writes/second (compared to amazon's 80).  The writes/second matches what happened without truecrypt, so I don't think encryption costs us anything.
