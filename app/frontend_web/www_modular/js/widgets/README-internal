The widgets folder contains JS files for each of the widgets. Each one returns a view which handles all of the events
and model (if needed) required for the widget. Generally the template (html file) is loaded from the DB by the context model,
and supplied as a argument upon initialization of the context model (on login, etc.). Some widgets explicitly specify a
template in the JS file if necessary, and many specify a template when loading another widget after an event is triggered.

Widgets which are primarily related to pathways are in the pathway folder, all others in are in this main folder.
