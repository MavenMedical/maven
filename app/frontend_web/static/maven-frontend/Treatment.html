Most acute rhinosinusitis resolves without treatment in two weeks. Uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis is generally diagnosed clinically and does not require a sinus CT scan or other imaging. Antibiotics are not recommended for patients with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis who have mild illness and assurance of follow-up. If a decision is made to treat, amoxicillin should be first-line antibiotic treatment for most acute rhinosinusitis.

Limited laboratory testing may be warranted to exclude underlying causes. Targeted laboratory testing based on clinical suspicion is appropriate. Routine extensive testing is neither cost effective nor associated with improved clinical outcomes. Skin or serum-specific IgE testing for inhalants or foods is not indicated, unless there is a clear history implicating an allergen as a provoking or perpetuating factor for urticaria.

                                           Immunoglobulin (gammaglobulin) replacement is expensive and does not improve outcomes unless there is impairment of antigen-specific IgG antibody responses to vaccine immunizations or natural infections. Low levels of immunoglobulins (isotypes or subclasses), without impaired antigen-specific IgG antibody responses, do not indicate a need for immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Exceptions include IgG levels <150mg/dl and genetically defined/suspected disorders. Measurement of IgG subclasses is not routinely useful in determining the need for immunoglobulin therapy. Selective IgA deficiency is not an indication for administration of immunoglobulin.

                                          Clinicians often rely solely upon symptoms when diagnosing and managing asthma, but these symptoms may be misleading and be from alternate causes. Therefore spirometry is essential to confirm the diagnosis in those patients who can perform this procedure. Recent guidelines highlight spirometry’s value in stratifying disease severity and monitoring control. History and physical exam alone may over- or under-estimate asthma control. Beyond the increased costs of care, repercussions of misdiagnosing asthma include delaying a correct diagnosis and treatment.

                                                   <p>  False or clinically irrelevant positive allergy tests for foods are frequent. Indiscriminate screening results in inappropriate avoidance of foods and wastes healthcare resources. IgE testing for specific foods must be driven by a history of signs or symptoms consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction after eating a particular food. Ordering IgE testing in individuals who do not have a history consistent with or suggestive for food allergy based on history frequently reveals positive tests that are unlikely to be clinically relevant. Testing, when done, should be limited to suspected foods.</p>

                                                    <p> The diagnostic utility of IgE testing for specific foods is optimal when a history compatible with or suggestive for the diagnosis of food allergy is present. In the absence of a compatible or suggestive history, the pre-test probability for a diagnosis of food allergy is low and a positive skin or in vitro IgE test does not establish a diagnosis of food allergy. Skin testing or serum testing for specific-IgE to food antigens has excellent sensitivity and high negative predictive value, but has low specificity and low positive predictive value.</p>

                                                    <p> Considering that 50 to 90 percent of presumed cases of food allergy do not reflect IgE-mediated (allergic) pathogenesis and may instead reflect food intolerance or symptoms not causally associated with food consumption, ordering panels of food tests leads to many incorrectly identified food allergies and inappropriate recommendations to avoid foods that are positive on testing.</p>

                                                  <p>    In a random telephone survey of 5,529 households with a census of 14,948 individuals, seafood allergy was reported by 3.3 percent of survey respondents. According to current U.S. population estimates for 2013, this corresponds to 10,395,000 Americans.</p>

                                                   <p>   The mechanism for anaphylaxis to radio-iodinated contrast media relates to the physiochemical properties of these media and is unrelated to its iodine content. Further, although delayed-type hypersensitivity (allergic contact dermatitis) reactions to iodine have rarely been reported, IgE-mediated reactions to iodine have not, and neither type of reaction would be related to IgE-mediated shellfish allergy nor to contrast media reactions. Patients with a history of prior anaphylaxis to contrast media are at elevated risk for anaphylactic reaction with re-exposure to contrast media.</p>

                                                  <p>    Patients with asthma or cardiovascular disease, or who are taking beta blockers, are at increased risk for serious anaphylaxis from radiographic contrast media.</p>

Studies in egg-allergic patients receiving egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine have not reported reactions; consequently egg-allergic patients should be given either egg-free influenza vaccine or should receive egg-based influenza vaccine with a 30-minute post-vaccine observation period. Egg-allergic patients receiving the yellow fever vaccine should be skin tested with the vaccine and receive the vaccine with a 30-minute observation period if the skin test is negative. If positive, the vaccine may be given in graded doses with appropriate medical observation.</p>

                                                   <p> Egg protein is present in influenza and yellow fever vaccines and in theory could cause reactions in egg-allergic patients. However, in 27 published studies collectively 4,172 patients with egg allergy received 4,729 doses of egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) with no cases of anaphylaxis, including 513 with severe egg allergy who uneventfully received 597 doses. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that egg-allergic persons receive IIV as a single dose without prior vaccine skin testing and be observed for 30 minutes afterwards for any possible allergic reaction. If the reaction to the ingestion of eggs was hives only, the vaccine can be administered in a primary care setting, whereas if the reaction to the ingestion of eggs was more severe, the vaccine should be administered in an allergist/immunologist’s office. Two new IIVs not grown in eggs have been approved for patients 18 years and older: Flucelvax, prepared from virus propagated in cell culture, and Flublok, recombinant hemagglutinin proteins produced in an insect cell line. For egg-allergic patients 18 years of age and older, either egg-based IIV can be used with the precautions above or egg-free IIV can be used.</p>

Thus, MMR and PCEC rabies vaccine can be administered to egg-allergic recipients in the usual manner.</p>

                                                    <p>Per the Yellow Fever vaccine package insert, egg-allergic recipients should be skin tested with the vaccine prior to administration. If negative, the vaccine can be given in the usual manner, but the patient should be observed for 30 minutes afterward. If the vaccine skin test is positive, the vaccine can be given in graded doses under appropriate medical observation.</p>

The main reason for this observation is that penicillin allergy is often misdiagnosed and when present wanes over time in most (but not all) individuals. Patients labeled penicillin-allergic are more likely to be treated with alternative antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinolones), have higher medical costs, experience longer hospital stays, and are more likely to develop complications such as infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and Clostridium difficile.</p>

                                                       <p> Evaluation for specific IgE to penicillin can be carried out by skin testing. Ideally, penicillin skin testing should be performed with both major and minor determinants. The negative predictive value of penicillin skin testing for immediate reactions approaches 100 percent, whereas the positive predictive value is between 40 and 100 percent. The usefulness of in vitro tests for penicillin-specific IgE is limited by their uncertain predictive value. They are not suitable substitutes for penicillin skin testing.</p>

                                                      <p>  By identifying the overwhelming majority of individuals who can safely receive penicillin and penicillin-like drugs, we can improve the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy and clinical care outcomes.</p>
