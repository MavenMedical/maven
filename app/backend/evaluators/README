The only TRULY functional file in this 'evaluators' directory is the 'composition_evaluator.py'

This file is responsible for listening to the 'incomingpatheval' RabbitMQ queue (this queue is populated
by incoming compositions sent to data_router_all_svcs.py.

Once the 'composition_evaluator.py' file receives a composition, it runs through the the various analyses,
populating the Alerts FHIR Section of the Composition with any alerts that are created (Transparent/Pathways/Recent
Results/etc.)

The 'composition_evaluator.py' then writes the Composition (which may or may not have Alerts attached to it now)
back to data_router_all_svcs.py via two different RabbitMQ queues, one for transparent and one for Pathways
b/c the notifications are handled differently for the two.

The extra files in this directory were the beginning attempts to parallelize the Transparent and Pathways analysis,
so that each would listen to it's own queue, but they would be spun up under the same thread (sort of the way
decorators are used for the HTTP routes). But this functionality got side-tracked in Summer of 2014 to focus on Pathways
exclusively.
