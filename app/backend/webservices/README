This package contains the handlers for our website, our http notification service, and an interface for the clientapp to talk with the other maven services.

data_router_all_svcs.py - as it's name implies, this file is the main hub moving data around  It's also one of the "main" functions of the maven services.  It starts up all of the web services, as well as the rpc to communicate with the clientapp(s).  It pushed compositions onto a rabbitmq queue, and processes them once the evaluators add notifications to them, sending them back to the clientapp for notifications.
